# Twitter Fake Tweet Detection Project

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on detecting fake tweets on Twitter. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification using various machine-learning techniques, and frequent pattern mining to identify recurring patterns associated with tweet labels.

## Abstract
The project addresses the challenges of detecting fake tweets on Twitter, utilizing techniques such as logistic regression and neural networks. The research explores user profiles, and patterns in tweet data, and employs machine learning models for classification. The use of ensemble modeling and frequent pattern mining enhances the accuracy and insights into the detection process.

## Research Questions
1. **Are certain user profiles more prevalent in sharing fake tweets?**
2. **What could be the major characteristics that can be used to determine if the tweet is real or fake?**
3. **Can we train a model that can detect if the tweet is fake based on its user profile?**
4. **Are there any frequent patterns that can be undermined from our dataset?**

## Project Phases
1. **Data Preprocessing and EDA**
Analyzed user profiles and tweets.
Explored relationships between tweet labels and user attributes (followers, following, etc.).
Investigated tweet text for common words and patterns.

2. **Classification Models**
Trained and evaluated various classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
Explored feature selection techniques to improve model performance.
Built an ensemble model combining multiple classifiers for enhanced accuracy.

3. **Frequent Pattern Mining**
Employed Apriori and FP-growth algorithms to identify recurring patterns in the dataset.
Explored patterns associated with real and fake tweets.

## Conclusion
Neural networks demonstrated superior performance, and an ensemble model combining various classifiers yielded the highest accuracy. The project aims to contribute to the identification of fake tweets on Twitter, addressing challenges related to data authenticity and platform usability.
